list view : 4.4 kitkat
-> it is not highly customisable
-> 300 contacts - 1contact * 1 kb = 300kb
-> the interation is slow

recyclerview : above kitkat 
-> highly customisable
-> 300 contacts - 1contact * 1 kb = 300(it occupies only the displayed data size)
-> interaction is fast

Steps to create a recyclerview :
	1.Add dependency for the recyclerview.
	2.Then you have to create the Recyclerview in layout file(XML) and give an ID.
	3.In the java class we have to declare and intialise the recyclerview.
	4.Create a seperate layout file(row.xml) for each row in the recyclerview.
	5.Create an adapter class in the first package of java.(Where,How,How much)
	6.Extend the adapter class with the recyclerview.
	7.Connect the row.xml to adapterclass,then display the data in the declared views.
	8.Create the reference for the adapter class in the main java file.
	9.Pass the data from the Main java class to adapter using the constructor.
	10.Set layout manager for the recyclerview to display the data in particular format.(Linear,Grid)
